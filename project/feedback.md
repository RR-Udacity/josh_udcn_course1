I just don't get this one.  I've had so many helpful reviews and this might be one of the most thorough...but least helpful.  We did some really complicated stuff around k8s, argocd, helm charts, etc.  But you nitpicked that I used docker-compose over docker... docker-compose makes working with docker far easier and more repeatable.  My commands and files worked perfectly well.  Removing docker-compose and running the commands manually are a step backward.

And the logging... come on.  Aside from missing the line asking for a DEBUG level base, mine worked fine.  I set everything to info, but when I changed one to "error" per your instructions it displayed at error level.  Making me spend 30 minutes trying to understand what your issue with it was and trying to find the specific line that would reduce the base level seems tedious and not value added.  I understand you have to grade to the rubric, but stil..

Finally on the connection count.  That one is silly.  The only way I could think to do it without a major refactoring was a global variable... and that's exactly how the mentor recommended it.  I added it, but don't think it's useful.  That number as a metric is meaningless and using a big global variable like that is an anti-pattern.
